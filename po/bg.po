"PURPOSE:\n"
"    This test will check that internal speakers work correctly\n"
"STEPS:\n"
"    1. Make sure that no external speakers or headphones are connected\n"
"       When testing a desktop, you can skip this test if there is no\n"
"       internal speaker, we will test the external output later\n"
"    2. Commence the test to play a brief tone on your audio device\n"
"VERIFICATION:\n"
"    Did you hear a tone?"
msgstr ""
"ПРЕДНАЗНАЧЕНИЕ:\n"
"    Този тест ще провери дали вградените високоговорители работят коректно\n"
"СТЪПКИ:\n"
"    1. Убедете се, че няма включени външни високоговорители или слушалки\n"
"       Когато тествате десктоп компютър Вие можете да пропуснете този тест, "
"ако не са\n"
"       налични вградени високоговорители, ние ще тестваме външния изход по-"
