_summary: Disk decryption after TPM change
_description:
 Check that the data partition cannot be decrypted (and therefore the device
 cannot boot) if PCR7 value is modified.
category_id: com.canonical.plainbox::disk
estimated_duration: 45m
plugin: manual
_purpose:
 The device partition is encrypted using TPM master key. To unseal the master
 key from TPM, PCR7 (Platform Configuration Register 7) needs to be identical
 to the value it had when the master key was sealed into TPM. Every time the
 device boots, it checks PCR7 to unseal TPM and retrieves master key from TPM
 to decrypt its data partition. If TPM PCR7 is modified (e.g. by flashing the
 BIOS), the device won't be able to get the master key and decrypt its data
 partition.
_steps:
 1. Install the image and make sure it boots and you can log in.
 2. Turn the device off and upgrade/downgrade the BIOS or modify Secure Boot state
 3. Make sure the BIOS is set up properly (e.g. TPM enabled, UEFI boot mode)
 4. Start the device
_verification:
 Mark this test as "Passed" if the device cannot boot anymore.
 Note: You must flash the BIOS back to the latest version, re-enable Secure Boot
 and re-install the image afterwards.
